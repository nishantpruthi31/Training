/* frames help us to select particular no of rows in a windows when using aggregate fxn , it does mot support ranking fxn */

-- rows between <starting> and <ending> -- pysical operator that looks at position of the rows
-- range between <starting> and <ending>  -- logical operator that looks at value of a expression

/* expression which can be used with rows and range*/
-- Unbounded Prcedding - The fram starts at first row in set.
-- Unbounded Following - Frame ends at last row of set
-- N PRECEDING - Phsyical no of rows before currrent row , supported with rows.
-- N Following - Physical no of rows after current tow , supported with rows
-- CURRENT ROW - The row of current calculation.
